Just like you did in the 02-flex-header exercise, you'll be nesting flex containers inside each other.

As with the last example, this one needs to be flexible in the middle, with items pushed to the left and right.

Everything is centered vertically inside the header.
There is 8px space between everything and the edge of the header.
Items are arranged horizontally as seen in the outcome image.
There is 16px between each item on both sides of the header.
flex is used to arrange everything.
